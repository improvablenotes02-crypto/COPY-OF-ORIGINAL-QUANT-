Order Intent

The risk-validated order produced by RiskEngine.

Consumes: a SetupCandidate (context.execution_signal) plus
the computed PositionSize from the PositionSizer.

Produced by: core.risk.risk_engine.RiskEngine
Consumed by: backtesting/backtester.py (which reads
context.order and hands it to the TradeSimulator) and
core/backtesting/trade_simulator.py (which reads
quantity / commission / slippage).
