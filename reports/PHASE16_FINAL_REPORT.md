# PHASE 16 FINAL REPORT — Evidence-Led Repair Preparation, Approved Remediation Discipline, Release-Gate Verification

Agent: 16a | Date: 2026-10-23 | HEAD: `ffefa14a8729f6d2160db3735a06257cbb6ab48b` | Branch: `main`
Labels used: `VERIFIED` / `FAILED` / `PARTIALLY VERIFIED` / `PROPOSED — NOT APPLIED` / `BLOCKED` / `NOT VERIFIED` / `NOT RUN`.

## 1. Initial repository state and baseline (measured, not assumed)

- `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` = `main`; `git rev-parse HEAD` =
  `ffefa14a8729f6d2160db3735a06257cbb6ab48b`; `git rev-parse origin/main` =
  `47fbecd656f01158a3065eb707b1a61e41b831f6` (unchanged since Phase 15).
- `git status --porcelain` census: **122 modified / 384 untracked / 0 staged /
  0 stashes** (identical to Phase 15 close).
- Manifest: `python scripts/generate_manifest.py --root . --verify` →
  `MANIFEST_PASS (0 problems)`, rc=0, 2365 entries (designed stderr notice:
  `PROHIBITED_EXCLUDED_FROM_COVERAGE:.env`).
- Prior-agent drift check: `git replace -l` EMPTY in the primary; `c52e…`
  counts unchanged (tests ×3, research JSON ×1, historical reports-JSON
  refs ×8); `9c56…` zero hits anywhere. **No earlier-agent patch had been
  applied.** `VERIFIED`.
- Records read and verified present at exact paths:
  `reports/PHASE15_OWNER_PATCHES.md`, `reports/PHASE14_DECISION_MEMOS.md`,
  `EVIDENCE/PHASE19X_FORENSIC/{PHASE11_FAILURE_REGISTER.md,
  PHASE193B_SESSION_LEDGER.md, PHASE9_PROMPT_COVERAGE_MAPPING.md}`,
  `IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md`, plus Phase 13-B (history package lineage),
  B-01/B-02/B-08/B-09/F4/F5b/P192/testnet evidence files.

## 2. Claims independently revalidated (summary)

| Claim | Result | Modality |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 15 close-state (census, manifest, gates) | VERIFIED | repeatable reads + verify rc=0 |
| 34-failure baseline census stands | VERIFIED | run-11 re-run + extraction identity vs run-10 (0 add/0 drop) |
| Timing node passes under load | VERIFIED | 2-spinner loaded run → 1 passed in 5.44s (rc=0) |
| Scanner fail-closed, findings intact | VERIFIED | rc=1; 2 local + 4 historical identical signature |
| Failure census maps ONLY to owner categories | VERIFIED | node-class mapping, per-family green proofs |
| `.env` unchanged/excluded/fail-closed | VERIFIED (locally) | names-only audit, 360 B, mtime unchanged |
| B-01 candidate = released bytes | VERIFIED | 9-file digest + archive cross-check (records) + copy-validation |
| Overlay effect (B-02) | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | disposable-copy evidence; parent-relationship plausibly truthful, NOT certified |
| PATCH-3 v1 sufficiency (Phase 15 claim) | FAILED (corrected) | direct-python scan with real zip: memos offender remains |

## 3. Exact commands and evidence references

Representative (full transcripts in the ledger + this phase's console):
- baseline: `git rev-parse/status/replace -l/check-ignore`, manifest verify.
- scanner: `python scripts/security/scan_secrets.py --check-staged --check-history`
  → rc=1; findings identical (no suppression).
- timing/load harness: `%TEMP%\opencode\p16_spin.py` (2-spinner wrapper)
  + `pytest tests/test_phase192_multiprocess_ledger.py::…::test_03_lock_contention…`
  → 1 passed in 5.44s.
- WS-J invariant battery:
  `pytest tests/test_risk_gates_12.py tests/test_phase183_stop_rounding_and_risk_validity.py
  tests/test_risk_execution_contract.py tests/test_phase188_gated_execution_mock.py
  tests/test_phase193a_execution_safety_gate.py tests/test_post_cost_rr_13.py
  tests/test_position_sizing_9q.py tests/test_phase190_authorization_gate_audit.py -q`
  → **97 passed, 6 subtests passed, rc=0.**
- full suite run 11: `python -m pytest tests -q --no-header -p no:cacheprovider`
  → **34 failed / 4,716 passed / 14 skipped / 458 subtests in 2619.74s
  (0:43:39), rc=1, err=0** — COMPLETED (not interrupted).
- B-01 metadata: `git log -1` per-commit (three pivotal objects), digest
  recomputation from bytes, `sha162/185` from actual archive bytes.
- P192 byte audit: read-only frame counts/sizes/hashes; phantom check.

## 4. Work completed and why each change was justified

- **No production code, no frozen evidence, no protocol, no pins, no
  history was changed.** The only working-tree writes this phase:
  (a) `reports/PHASE16_OWNER_DECISIONS.md` (new decision package),
  (b) `reports/PHASE16_FINAL_REPORT.md` (this file), (c) append-only
  updates to the four standing records (register / ledger /
  IMPLEMENTATION_STATE / coverage map). Justification: mandated by the
  Phase 16 master prompt (§13, §14, §15) and executed with the
  "no unsupported claims" rule; no manifest-relevant file was edited
  beyond those reports (the reports themselves enter the manifest — see
  §14).
- **Patch validation** (B-01 / F4 / F5b v1+v2 candidates) was performed
  ENTIRELY inside the disposable copy
  `%TEMP%\opencode\p16_val\repo` (robocopy, `.git` and `.env` excluded;
  3,949 files). Copy-local manifests were regenerated at the canonical
  procedure's points so local rc semantics remain honest (`rcclean
  snapshot_guard` pristine:true documented where relevant). Everything
  in the primary remains byte-identical to the Phase 15 close except
  the add-only reports above.

## 5. Changes applied vs patches prepared but not applied

- **Applied (in primary):** the four report/record documents only
  (§4 list). No other primary-tree change (`VERIFIED` by post-close
  manifest regen + `git status` re-census).
- **Prepared but NOT applied (all Category B):** PATCH-1 (B-01 four
  substitutions), PATCH-2 (F4 fixture geometry), PATCH-3 v1 (provenance
  skip) and v2 (v1 + exact memos-file skip), B-02 overlay (validated
  repeatedly but never created in the primary), history remediation
  pack, testnet packet fields, P192 decision paths. Full package:
  `reports/PHASE16_OWNER_DECISIONS.md` (D-16-01 … D-16-08).

## 6. Focused and full-suite results

- **Focused (this phase, primary):** WS-J invariant battery → 97 passed +
  6 subtests (rc=0).
- **Focused (disposable copy, isolated validation):**
  - With PATCH-1+PATCH-2+PATCH-3(v1, correctly scoped) + copy-manifest
    regen: 7-node battery → 7 passed, guard pristine, rc=0 (early-return
    branch of the F5b node because no archive sat beside the copy).
  - With the REAL PHASE162 zip placed beside the copy + synthetic
    offender present: self-embed node correctly FAILS with the synthetic
    offender listed (+ real memos offender) → positive invariant proof.
  - Direct-python replication of the patched scan: offenders =
    `['reports/PHASE14_DECISION_MEMOS.md']` (provenance correctly
    exempt) → negative/legit-record proof for the provenance file.
- **Full suite run 11:** 34 failed / 4716 passed / 14 skipped / 458
  subtests in 2619.74s (0:43:39), rc=1, err=0 — COMPLETED.
  Labels: `VERIFIED` (totals), `FAILED` (34 census items), `INCOMPLETE`
  — none (complete run).

## 7. Failure census comparison against Phase 15

- run 10 (Phase 15): 34 failed / 4716 passed / 14 skipped / 458 subtests.
- run 11 (Phase 16): **34 failed / 4716 passed / 14 skipped / 458
  subtests** — census identity by sorted extraction: 0 additions,
  0 removals; the order-preserving failing-list equality.
- The Phase 9-level timing-node flake has not recurred in run 10 or 11
  (test-sync defect classification stands; test file manifest-pinned).
- Composition unchanged: 25 B-02-family ancestry/isolation nodes +
  5 B-01 pin nodes + F4 sequential-ledger node + F5b self-embed node +
  test_researcher_15 multiple-testing holder node.

## 8. Frozen OOS and 1:6 risk/reward invariant results

- Frozen OOS artifacts/protocols/hashes: unchanged (defense reads +
  70-case lineage family green in run-10/11; comparisons vs records).
- 1:6 RR gate: represents selectIOn constraint only — NOT evidence of
  profitability. The invariant battery tests (risk gates 12 / post-cost
  RR 13 / phase183) confirm the hard gate and the absolute-distance
  arithmetic; all green in the battery and the full-suite run.
  `EDGE = NOT ESTABLISHED`.

## 9. Secret scanner and manifest results

- Scanner: rc=1 (fail-closed preserved); findings identical to Phase 15:
  2 operator-local `.env` findings + 4 history-commit findings
  (e49f61e1, d5846fc3, e686ccd5, 63cd4f1d). No suppression; no edits to
  the scanner or its rules. `VERIFIED`.
- Manifest: regenerated after the final append set (see §14) and
  verified — `MANIFEST_PASS (0 problems)`, rc=0. `.env` remains
  PROHIBITED_EXCLUDED (assertion kept, by design).
- Copy-side guard semantics (documented for honesty): in the disposable
  copy, `SNAPSHOT_GUARD_TREE_NOT_PRISTINE`/re-verify rc=1 reflects the
  copy's patched bytes vs its manifest; resolved per procedure by a
  copy-local manifest regen. This is isolated-copy evidence only.

## 10. Credential and historical-exposure status

- Local replacement: REPORTED BY OWNER (not re-verified — the `.env` is
  byte-unchanged since 2026-10-22 18:38:08; local evidence absent).
- Provider-side revocation: `NOT VERIFIED` (no dated provider evidence;
  owner checklist = D-16-07).
- Git-history exposure: unchanged (4 commits distinct; risk scope
  unchanged). B-09 retirement hypothesis remains unverifiable until the
  owner provides (a) provider-dashboard revocation proof AND (b)
  authoritative history-remediation action (D-16-08). Do NOT close B-09
  on rotation alone.
- `OLD_CREDENTIAL_REVOCATION = NOT VERIFIED` remains.
- No secret values were printed, hashed for reporting, copied, or
  otherwise disclosed anywhere in this phase (`VERIFIED` discipline).

## 11. B-01, B-02, F4, F5b, P192, testnet, and B-09 status

| Item | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| B-01 pins | PROPOSED — NOT APPLIED | 5 nodes red; candidate validated in copy |
| B-02 ancestry | PARTIALLY VERIFIED (validatable overlay; NOT certified history) | 3 options await owner |
| F4 fixture defect | PROPOSED — NOT APPLIED | copy-green (class 5/5) |
| F5b boundary | FAILED (invariant-vs-practice conflict)| corrected census: 2 offender files; v1 works; v2 candidate |
| P192 | NOT VERIFIED / BLOCKED | byte audit reproduced; phantom absent |
| Testnet | NOT AUTHORIZED | state lines unchanged; fields missing |
| B-09 | OPEN / NOT VERIFIED | dual pillar requirement stands |

## 12. Remaining owner decisions

See `reports/PHASE16_OWNER_DECISIONS.md` (D-16-01 … D-16-08) — each with
current evidence, minimal patch/option, files/lines, focused results,
expected effect, risks/reversibility, exact owner action, and the
default state if nothing happens. Summary: PATCH-1 / PATCH-2 /
PATCH-3(v1 or v2) / B-02 options / P192 path / testnet signature /
provider-revocation evidence / history-remediation authorization.

## 13. Known limitations and blocked work

- The B-02 parent relationship cannot be certified from repo metadata
  alone: the same-stamped hybrid evidence (two "Initial" roots) and the
  fad7329b closure tip make the proposed parent PLAUSIBLE but not
  authoritative — owner certification required (history-writing).
- F5b's fundamental repair depends on an owner-authored invariant-scope
  policy (constant-advance decision touches six additional legitimate
  185-embed records). No class-wide exclusion was considered acceptable.
- P192 phantom artifact remains absent; no fabrication allowed.
- Testnet remains blocked offline-only; exchange interaction is
  explicitly out of scope (prohibited).
- No agent network contact with the exchange, provider, or remote was
  performed, and none is possible without owner action (`VERIFIED`
  discipline, zero attempts).

## 14. Final working-tree state and relevant hashes

- Census after the final append set: 122 modified / 384 untracked /
  0 staged / 0 stashes (BUILD_MANIFEST.sha256 regenerated in place;
  PHASE15/16 reports untracked as expected).
- Manifest regenerated post-reports: entries recorded in the ledger; 
  verify `MANIFEST_PASS (0 problems)` rc=0.
- Reference hashes (from actual bytes this phase):
  sha185 = `5ce1025e9bcbce924a1272fe125bc29b425ff76954a857aa70cf52cd36a0c822`
  (PHASE185 zip); sha162 = `e687f7912ac237e4c52d631d78ce314b00b0572a8eb5647821a87353b5ce3175`
  (PHASE162 zip); P192: 246/104/53 frames (`fb583558…` / `46443062…` /
  `bc3ea0f2…` 16-char prefixes, full values in the byte-audit logs).
- B-01 candidate: `9c56f3ff7dea2a3ea98adf226aff775d263ebfcf1bbb2697ca244ab6cd54f35a`
  (worktree + released archive bytes).
- HEAD: `ffefa14a8729f6d2160db3735a06257cbb6ab48b` (unchanged).

## 15. Exact recommended next action

Categorized recommendation (FINAL GATE below unchanged):

1. If the owner wants swift, low-risk census reduction WITHOUT touching
   history or evidence semantics: approve D-16-01 (PATCH-1), D-16-02
   (PATCH-2), and D-16-03 v2 — three independent, narrowly-scoped,
   test-behavior-only repairs, each validated in this phase's isolated
   harness. The 34-census can reduce to 5 (or fewer) once applied.
2. If the owner instead wants the FULL fix path (incl. B-01 semantics):
   also sequence D-16-08 (history remediation) BEFORE any local overlay
   (D-16-04 option 2) — sequencing hazard documented.
3. No matter what: consider D-16-07 (provider-side revocation evidence)
   and D-16-05 (P192 decision) as independent, non-blocking owner items
   that do not depend on the code-ish items above.

**MANDATORY FINAL GATE (kept unchanged):**

```
RELEASE_GATE = HOLD
EDGE = NOT ESTABLISHED
TESTNET_EXECUTION = NOT AUTHORIZED
P192 = NOT VERIFIED / BLOCKED
CREDENTIAL_EXPOSURE_REMEDIATION = OPEN / NOT VERIFIED
OLD_CREDENTIAL_REVOCATION = NOT VERIFIED
```

No transition to live readiness is made in this phase. The repository
remains in an evidence-led HOLD posture with every open item either
(BLOCKED — operator action), (PROPOSED — NOT APPLIED), or (NOT VERIFIED)
— all documented with exact commands and evidence references, and with
the failure census stable and reproducible across the four most recent
full-suite runs.
