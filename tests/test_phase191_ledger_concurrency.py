"""
QuantEngine Phase 191 — Cross-Process Ledger Concurrency & Safety Audit Test Suite.

Audits Task 3 requirements:
  1. Authoritative cumulative order limit (20 orders max) strictly enforced across concurrent callers.
  2. Serialized check-and-reserve operations prevent slot oversubscription.
  3. Bounded wait on cross-process lock raises LockTimeoutError without hanging indefinitely.
  4. Concurrent callers attempting duplicate client order IDs are refused.
  5. Crash-safe fsync persistence ensures immediate durability across process boundaries.
  6. Corrupted or malformed ledger fails closed across all concurrent processes.
  7. Zero exchange order writes across all concurrency tests.
