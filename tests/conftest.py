"""Session-level snapshot guard: a test run must not mutate the packaged tree.

The Phase158 independent audit found that running tests physically rewrote
manifest-covered files.  On Windows the rewrite happens to be byte-identical
(text-mode newline translation reproduces the CRLF the file already has), so it
is invisible there; the same run on a platform with different newline
conventions changes bytes, invalidates ``BUILD_MANIFEST.sha256`` mid-run, and
makes the "an extraction still verifies after the suite" claim false on that
platform.

This guard turns "the suite leaves the snapshot byte-identical" into an
enforced property of every session, without touching any test:

* session start: every manifest-covered file is read into memory and checked
  against ``BUILD_MANIFEST.sha256``; a tree that is already non-pristine is
  reported as ``SNAPSHOT_GUARD_TREE_NOT_PRISTINE`` and fails the session;
* after every test: a watchlist of files the suite is known to rebuild in
  place (each has a change-detector test that re-runs its builder) is checked
  and restored byte-exactly when a test changed it;
* every 50 tests and again at session end: the whole covered set is checked,
  every changed file is restored from the session snapshot, and files a test
  *added* to the tree are reported (and fail the session);
* every restore emits ``SNAPSHOT_GUARD_RESTORED <path>`` and the session ends
  with a machine-readable ``SNAPSHOT_GUARD_SUMMARY {json}`` line.

The guard restores bytes a test wrote over; it never hides the event and never
weakens an assertion.  A test that reads a sealed artifact after another test
rebuilt it sees the recorded bytes, exactly as if the rebuild had not happened
-- which is the property the release claims.
